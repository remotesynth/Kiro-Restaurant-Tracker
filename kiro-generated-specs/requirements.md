# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Restaurant Tracker is a serverless application deployed to AWS that allows food enthusiasts to save and track restaurants they wish to visit or have already visited. Users can maintain a personal collection of restaurants with details such as name, location, cuisine type, and description. After visiting a restaurant, users can add reviews with star ratings and text notes to document their experiences. The application provides a simple way for foodies to organize their dining experiences and discover new places to try.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication

**User Story:** As a food enthusiast, I want to create an account with just my email address using passwordless authentication, so that I can securely access my restaurant collection without remembering another password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user enters their email address for signup THEN the system SHALL send a magic link to that email.
3. WHEN a user clicks the magic link THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and create an account if one doesn't exist.
4. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain their session across visits until explicitly logged out.
5. WHEN a user attempts to access protected features without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page.

### Requirement 2: Restaurant Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add new restaurants to my collection with minimal required information, so that I can quickly save places I'm interested in visiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user submits a restaurant with only the name field completed THEN the system SHALL save the restaurant with only that information.
3. WHEN a user adds a restaurant THEN the system SHALL mark it as "not visited" by default.
4. WHEN a user selects cuisine type THEN the system SHALL present a dropdown list of common cuisine types.
5. WHEN a user views their restaurant list THEN the system SHALL display the restaurant name, location (if provided), cuisine type (if provided), and visited status.
6. WHEN a user selects a restaurant from their list THEN the system SHALL display all available details including description and reviews.

### Requirement 3: Restaurant Review System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add reviews to restaurants I've visited, so that I can remember my experiences and make better decisions about future visits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a restaurant THEN the system SHALL provide an option to mark it as visited.
2. WHEN a user marks a restaurant as visited THEN the system SHALL enable review functionality.
3. WHEN a user reviews a restaurant THEN the system SHALL allow them to add a star rating (0-5) and text notes.
4. WHEN a user has already provided a star rating THEN the system SHALL allow them to adjust it on subsequent visits.
5. WHEN a user adds a review note THEN the system SHALL append it to any existing notes with a timestamp.
6. WHEN a user views a restaurant they've reviewed THEN the system SHALL display the star rating and all review notes in chronological order.

### Requirement 4: Restaurant List View

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a list of all my saved restaurants with key information, so that I can quickly find and select restaurants I'm interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the restaurant list is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the name, location, cuisine type, and visited status for each restaurant.

4. WHEN a user wants to find a specific restaurant THEN the system SHALL provide search and filter functionality.
5. WHEN a user filters by cuisine type THEN the system SHALL display only restaurants matching that cuisine.
6. WHEN a user filters by visited status THEN the system SHALL display only visited or unvisited restaurants.

### Requirement 5: Restaurant Detail View

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed information about a specific restaurant, so that I can see all the information I've saved and any reviews I've added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a restaurant from the list THEN the system SHALL display a detailed view with all available information.
2. WHEN viewing restaurant details THEN the system SHALL display name, location, cuisine type, description, visited status, star rating (if any), and review notes (if any).
